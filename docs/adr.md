# Architecture Decision Records

## 2026-08-10 - Expand the Dependabot grouping task to remediate npm audit findings

- Task: Issue #199 and Sub-issue #200.
- Decision: Update direct and transitive npm dependency baselines together with the Dependabot security grouping configuration.
- Reason: Validation of the configuration-only change found existing moderate, high, and critical vulnerabilities, which prevented the required compile and security checks from passing.
- Compatibility: Keep all dependency updates within their existing major-version ranges and add regression tests for the safe version floors.
